# Heart-Disease-Predictor
Methodology:
To explain and identify the problem and resolve medical objectives, diï¬€erent data Science technique, which interpret the medical goals, have been implemented to diagnose the heart disease and to improve the success standards of the algorithms for prediction. Suitable machine learning algorithms, like: Random Forest, SVM (Support Vector Machine), Decision Tree and Logistics Regression were preferred for the training and implementation in python for developing and evolving the predictive model however the best result were obtained by Logistic Regression model. This algorithms executed on the model will help medical experts to predict and diagnose heart attacks in the patient dataset. The main goal is to identify which machine-learning algorithm has the best accuracy for the prediction of heart disease from the patient dataset.


Outliers in the data are removed by Z-score and IQR method for better performance of model
