# Heart-Disease-Predictor
Methodology:
To explain and identify the problem and resolve medical objectives, diï¬€erent data Science technique, which interpret the medical goals, have been implemented to diagnose the heart disease and to improve the success standards of the algorithms for prediction. Suitable machine learning algorithms, like: Random Forest, SVM (Support Vector Machine), Decision Tree and Logistics Regression were preferred for the training and implementation in python for developing and evolving the predictive model. These algorithms executed on the model will help medical experts to predict and diagnose heart attacks in the patient dataset. The main goal is to identify which machine-learning algorithm has the best accuracy for the prediction of heart disease from the patient dataset.

Result:
Cross Validation is also done for all the models. The results are same but have some variance in accuracy. After Cross Validation the result become clear that Logistic regression is good for this problem
